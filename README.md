This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This App is a place where you can find and add soccer shoes. Share a new shoe that you don't see on the site and discover/ research new shoes. This App is created with React & Redux for the frontend and connected to a Rails JSON API to persist data in the backend.

##Features:

View a collection of shoes
View an individual shoe
Add a new shoe to the Collection
Like a shoe and see how many likes that shoe has
You can delete shoes
Has an About page
Has a Homepage/Welcome page

## Available Scripts

In the project directory

Fork/clone the repo into your terminal and in the project directory run:
bundle install
rake start to start the server.

If the localhost doesn't open automatically, copy and paste.<br>
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
